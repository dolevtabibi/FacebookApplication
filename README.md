# WinForms Facebook Application
**This is a Facebook desktop application developed using the Facebook API in WinForms with Visual Studio. It provides a basic Facebook experience and was developed as part of the Design Patterns (C#) course.**

# Features:
  * Six Design Patterns implemented to enhance code structure and maintainability.
  * Multithreading to handle concurrent tasks efficiently.
  * Serialization for saving and loading application data.
  * Data Binding to establish a connection between the application's UI and underlying data.

    **NOTE:** Only Facebook developer users can sign in to the application, and the friends list will only display Facebook developer users.
